- [**EC-Pisa-15_4_288**](https://github.com/dimitri-thomopulos/DASH-REC/tree/main/Instances/EC-Pisa-15_4_288): This folder contains a sample dataset demonstrating the data fields and their organization for energy community management.

## Usage
Each case study or instance is contained in the corresponding folder that contains the data files in DASH-EC format and available extensions. In addition where available there is also a specific explanation of the related data.
Individual file names minus the extension correspond to the folder name.
The general rule for naming each instance is to begin with the term *EC*, then separated with a hyphen, follows an identifier of the instance's geolocation, which can be a name or, for example, some latitude and longitude coordinates. Finally, again separated by a hyphen, follows an identifier indicating the temporality of the instance.
An example of a name is *EC-Pisa-15_4_288* where *Pisa* indicates the name of the province to which the data are referenced, *15* is the duration in minutes of each period, *4* are the time intervals considered,  and *288* is the duration in periods of each interval.
