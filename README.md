Data Sharing for Renewable Energy Communities (DASH-REC) is a repository for datasets and code resources aimed at studying and supporting the management of Renewable Energy Communities (RECs).

## Contents
- **Instances**: This folder contains all the available data for the considered case studies
  - **REC-Pisa-15_4_288**: This folder contains a sample dataset demonstrating the data fields and their organization for energy community management.

## Usage
The dataset can be used as a starting point for developing applications, conducting research, or exploring data analysis techniques specific to energy community management. Feel free to utilize the data to gain insights, develop models, or prototype your own solutions.

## Contributing
As the repository currently contains only an example dataset, contributions in the form of feedback, suggestions, or additional datasets related to energy community management are highly welcome. 

## REC format manual
A comprehensive manual outlining the data format will be made available in the near future, providing detailed instructions and information.

## License
The code and instances provided within DASH-REC are freely available for non-commercial use. However, if you choose to utilize them, it is necessary to provide proper attribution and reference.
